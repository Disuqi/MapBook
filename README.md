# MapBook
I was involved in a project as part of one of my modules. The website allows users to register and add friends, you are also able to view your friend's locations. Initially, you could see your friends on a map with the GoogleMap API. However, the free trial for this feature has since concluded, therefore the map feature is inactive.
